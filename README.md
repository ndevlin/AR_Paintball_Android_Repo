# AR_Paintball_Android_Repo
 
Implemented in Unity using C#

Cube Synchrony: Rectangle on phone and computer rotate together in synchrony according to phone's gyroscope inputs


Paint Ball:

Paint balls shoot forward when pressing the front shoot button on the phone. They are present on both the phone and computer screen. Paintballs shoot up when the user swipes on the screen. When the camera cannot see the target image, the phone's gyroscope is used to aim the paintballs. The paintballs successfully shoot towards the screen and splat on the target image.


Note: The main files of interest are in the Assets folder, such as Assets/Scripts. The Windows build is in Windows_Build, and the Android build is in the Android_Phone_Build
